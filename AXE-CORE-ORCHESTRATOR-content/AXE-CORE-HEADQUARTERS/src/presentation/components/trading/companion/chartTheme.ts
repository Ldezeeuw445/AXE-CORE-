/**
 * AXE Chart Theme System
 *
 * 4 presets: Midnight (OLED black), Charcoal (warm dark), Slate (TradingView-style),
 * Paper (light mode). Each preset defines candle, grid, axis, and overlay colors
 * calibrated for legibility on its background.
 *
 * Grid style is a per-user preference (solid = no grid, grid = with gridlines),
 * persisted in localStorage.
 *
 * Ported 1:1 from AXE Companion (src/components/chart/chartTheme.ts) — no
 * Next.js/Companion-specific dependencies, so this file is verbatim.
